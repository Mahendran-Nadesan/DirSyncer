Solution was online:
Use lambda:
command=lambda dir=self.some_dir_variable: self.browse_callback(dir)

Setting up a single Tkinter button callback for multiple StringVars

My GUI has two "browse" buttons which both call tkFileDialog.askdirectory.
However, they will point to different folders. I was hoping I could pass in arguments in the button callback:

self.some_dir_variable = StringVar(self)
self.some_dir_variable2 = StringVar(self) 
self.browse_1 = Button(self.frame_5, text="Browse", command=self.browse_callback(self.some_dir_variable))
self.browse_2 = Button(self.frame_2, text="Browse", command=self.browse_callback(self.some_dir_variable2))        

The function initially looked like this:

def browse1_callback(self, dirvar):
        mydir = tkFileDialog.askdirectory(parent=None, initialdir="c:\\",title="Select a directory")
        dirvar.set(mydir)
        
However, this didn't work out - running the GUI immediately runs the askdirectory dialog (as well as not preserving the original grid arrangements). Once the askdirectory dialog is cancelled, the button does nothing.
I really would like to not have a callback for each button, since they call the same dialog and both just set a variable.
Could anyone suggest a way to implement this?
