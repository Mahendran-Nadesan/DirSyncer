DirSyncer

Small GUI app to synchronise the contents of two directories.

Directions:
- Browse and select *both* directories.
- Click "Sync Options".
- Click the appropriate "Sync" button (the directory which you want as your "master" directory), or the "Sync All" button.

Notes on limitations:
This app is meant to be hugely limited. One of the biggest one is that, if you choose to "sync all", a directory/file which you deleted in one directory, and wish to not copy, will be copied (because it exists in one of the target directories).
The workarounds are: delete both manually before syncing, or pick the directory with the deleted contents as your "master" - i.e. click that directory's "Sync" button.

Aims:
- Practice Tkinter, writing classes
